# Dota2Cheat: 7.37d

![v4 image](https://github.com/ExistedGit/Dota2Cheat/assets/66470490/88dbfa94-0ba3-4d53-b355-8cb18de98d71)

There weren't many open-source Dota cheats. And so I decided to fix that. Written in C++20 with love.

A few SDK bits were fully or partionally taken from [McDota](https://github.com/LWSS/McDota) by LWSS, which D2C is inspired by.

Using [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) with DirectX 11 for the interface

also using [Minhook](https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook) for them trampolines

also using Google's [Protocol Buffers](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf) for net message handling

Cheers to their wonderful creators!

## Building

*(If you don't want to sit through building the DLL, you can get it frm the Releases tab)*

You can build this project using Visual Studio 2022.

If you don't have it, [set up vcpkg for Visual Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/get_started/get-started-msbuild?pivots=shell-cmd#1---set-up-vcpkg).

You will also need to install the [June 2010 DirectX SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812)

Open the project in Visual Studio, switch Configuration from Debug to **Release** and press `Ctrl + Shift + B` to build the solution. It'll download dependencies which might take some time.
The DLL will be found in `Build/Release/` (relative to the folder you cloned D2C into)

## Injecting

This cheat can be safely reinjected at any point of the game

If using D2C for the first time or updating from an older version — run `setup_data.bat` to copy D2C's resources to your Documents folder.

**Use at own risk** (also consider not using non-legit features that you can get reported/flagged for)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter an error and want to coherently report it:

### Debugging

This method is for errors that are easily reproducible. You're meant to be playing either in the demo mode or a lobby(not on a VAC-protected server!)
Build both the cheat and loader in Debug. Launch dota 2, then In Visual Studio Ctrl + Alt + P and select dota2.exe.
Now that you're debugging the process, inject the cheat and trigger the error. VS will show you where the exception occurs.

### What to do when an error appears

Upon an exception, examine the file and lines it happened on. In the Call Stack tab you'll be able to trace the call to the function(in case the exception place doesn't provide enough information). Screenshot all of this and then you can make an Issue here with the data.

# For Developers

Check out the repo's Wiki, I add useful pieces of information about dota-specific cheat things there. \
Also has a guide on how to update it.
